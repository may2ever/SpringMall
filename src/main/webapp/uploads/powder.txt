Kamsahamnida!

Thank you very much for your donation!

As promised, I can now reveal to you the secret codes to unlock
POWDER's special modes.  Remember that great power comes with
great responsibility: keep these potent runes hidden from prying
eyes!

To enter the code, type in the code (or tap, in the case of the DS)
the codeword as your character name.  They are all lower case.

Code Word: bathtub
This unlocks wizard mode.  The Wish command brings up a menu of
choices to grant items, teleport levels, create monsters, etc.
Perfect for exploration of the stranger aspects of POWDER.  Note that
these characters aren't eligible for high scores.

Code Word: modulus
This unlocks stress test mode.  POWDER will start playing itself,
creating random characters on random levels and seeing what happens.
I use this to debug - I figure things are stable if it lasts a few
million turns without crashing.  But I find watching it entertaining
and hope you do too!

If you have any questions about the code words, or difficulties
getting them to work, please feel free to e-mail me.  The same is true
for POWDER in general, of course.

Thank you again for your support of POWDER development.  I have added
your name to my list of donaters.  If there are any new things added
to the donation program (new code words, or change of code words), I
will let you know.  Unless, of course, you request not to hear from me
again.

Sincerely,
Jeff Lait
